# E-commerce Analysis Project

This project analyzes e-commerce data using SQL to provide insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. The project includes scripts to create the database schema, populate it with sample data, and run various analytical queries.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze an e-commerce dataset and derive actionable insights. The database consists of tables such as `Customers`, `Products`, `Orders`, and `OrderDetails`. The analysis focuses on key metrics like total sales, top-performing products, customer purchase behavior, and more.

## Features

- Database schema creation script
- Data population script with sample data
- Analytical SQL queries to extract insights
- Organized and reusable SQL scripts

## How It Works

1. **Database Schema**: The `create_tables.sql` script creates a structured database with tables for:
   - **Customers**: Stores customer information like names and contact details.
   - **Products**: Contains details of the items available for purchase.
   - **Orders**: Tracks orders placed by customers.
   - **OrderDetails**: Links orders with products and their quantities.

2. **Data Population**: The `insert_data.sql` script populates these tables with sample data, mimicking a real-world e-commerce environment.

3. **Analysis Queries**: The `analysis_queries.sql` script runs SQL commands to analyze the dataset, providing insights such as:
   - Which products generate the most revenue.
   - The customers contributing the most to sales.
   - Trends in orders over time.
   - Performance of product categories.

### For Businesses:
- **Identify Key Revenue Drivers**: Understand which products or categories perform the best.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Learn which customers contribute the most to sales to target them effectively.
- **Operational Trends**: Spot sales trends and plan for seasonal demands.

### For Data Enthusiasts:
- **SQL Practice**: Provides a hands-on experience with SQL queries, schema creation, and data manipulation.
- **Problem Solving**: Offers real-world scenarios for solving business problems through data.
- **Portfolio Development**: A great project to showcase skills in database management and analysis.

### For Analysts and Developers:
- **Efficiency in Insights**: Saves time by automating data retrieval and presenting meaningful insights.
- **Customizable Framework**: The database schema and queries can be tailored to other datasets or industries.

3. Open your SQL client and execute the following steps:

   - Run the `create_tables.sql` script to create the database schema.
   - Run the `insert_data.sql` script to populate the database with sample data.

4. Execute the `analysis_queries.sql` script to run the analysis queries.

## Usage

1. Open your SQL client and connect to your database.
2. Execute the scripts in the following order:
   - `create_tables.sql`
   - `insert_data.sql`
   - `analysis_queries.sql`
3. Review the query results for insights into the dataset.
